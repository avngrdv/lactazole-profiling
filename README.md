# About

This repository holds python scripts to reproduce the results of the reactivity-profiling mRNA display performed on the lactazole biosynthetic pathway. The repository holds the scripts to process .fastq files (single read MiSeq sequencing output) generated from a reactivity-profiling mRNA display experiment.

For details, refer to the publication. (unpublished as of now).
The associated NGS sequencing data is uploaded to DDBJ (link to be released).

# Usage

The usage of the scripts is demonstrated in a jupyter notebook (usage.ipynb).

# Dependencies

Python 3.7.3
Numpy 1.18.5
