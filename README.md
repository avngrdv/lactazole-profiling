# About

This repository holds python scripts to reproduce the results of the reactivity-profiling mRNA display performed on the lactazole biosynthetic pathway. The repository holds the scripts to process .fastq files (single read MiSeq sequencing output) generated from a reactivity-profiling mRNA display experiment. \
